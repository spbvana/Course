Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and Conquer algorithm is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts, solving each part individually, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem. It is a widely used algorithmic technique in computer science and mathematics.

Example: In the Merge Sort algorithm, the “Divide and Conquer” strategy is used to sort a list of elements. Below image illustrate the dividing and merging states to sort the array using Merge Sort.
